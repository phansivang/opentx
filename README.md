# OpenTX

A Go package for initializing and managing OpenTelemetry SDK.


`OpenTX` is a Go package designed to simplify the initialization and management of the **OpenTelemetry SDK**. It 
provides a clean and easy-to-use API for setting up tracing in your Go applications, making it effortless to integrate OpenTelemetry for observability.

Whether you're building microservices, APIs, or any distributed system, `opentx` helps you instrument your code with 
OpenTelemetry traces and export them to your preferred backend (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin, or any OTLP-compatible collector).

---
## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/phansivang/opentx
```

## Features

- **Easy Setup**: Initialize the OpenTelemetry SDK with just a few lines of code.
- **OTLP Support**: Export traces using the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) over gRPC.
- **Resource Configuration**: Automatically attach service names and other attributes to your traces.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Properly shut down the tracing pipeline to ensure all spans are exported.

---
## Usage

```bash
package main

import (
	"context"
	"log"
	"time"

	"github.com/phansivang/opentx"
)

func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()

	// Initialize OpenTelemetry SDK
	err := OpenTX.SetupOpenTxSDK(ctx, "localhost:4317", "my-service")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to initialize OpenTelemetry SDK: %v", err)
	}
	defer OpenTX.Shutdown(ctx)

	// Your application logic here
	time.Sleep(10 * time.Second)
}
```
## Configuration

`OpenTX` requires the following configuration:

- **OpenTxTarget**: The OpenTx endpoint (e.g., `localhost:4317`).
- **ServiceName**: The name of your service for tracing.

---

## Example

Hereâ€™s an example of using `OpenTX` in a simple HTTP server:
```bash
package main

import (
	"context"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"time"

	"github.com/phansivang/opentx"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel"
)

func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()

	// Initialize OpenTelemetry SDK
	err := OpenTX.SetupOpenTxSDK(ctx, "localhost:4317", "my-http-service")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to initialize OpenTelemetry SDK: %v", err)
	}
	defer OpenTX.Shutdown(ctx)

	// Create a simple HTTP server
	http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		ctx := r.Context()
		tracer := otel.Tracer("my-http-service")
		_, span := tracer.Start(ctx, "handle-request")
		defer span.End()

		w.Write([]byte("Hello, world!"))
	})

	log.Println("Starting HTTP server on :8080")
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
}
```
## Why Use `OpenTX`?

- **Simplicity**: Abstracts away the complexity of setting up OpenTelemetry.
- **Best Practices**: Follows OpenTelemetry best practices for resource configuration and trace exporting.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extendable to support additional OpenTelemetry features (e.g., metrics, logs).
